### ✨ Hey, I'm Tássio Jordão (TJ)

I'm a **Senior Frontend Engineer** who loves turning complexity into clean, scalable code.

My day-to-day? Architecting high-performing platforms using **Vue**, **React**, **TypeScript**, and **Nx** — with a strong focus on performance, observability, and DevOps collaboration. I’ve worked on e-commerce systems, improved CDN caching, and helped teams ship with more confidence and less friction.
